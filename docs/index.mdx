title: AFK
description: Build production-ready agent systems with policy, tools, memory, and provider-agnostic LLM orchestration.
---

AFK (Agent Forge Kit) is an agent runtime focused on safe orchestration, deterministic behavior, and practical developer experience.

<Tip>
Language support roadmap: this docs site uses the current Python SDK examples today, with TypeScript, Go, and Rust SDK docs planned next.
